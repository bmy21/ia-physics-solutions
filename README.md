#  IA Physics solutions

This repository contains my worked solutions, in PDF format, to some of the course problems and past exam questions from the Part IA Physics course at the University of Cambridge. The topics covered are Special Relativity, Gravity & Electromagnetism. I typed up these solutions while I was teaching the course during the Easter term of 2020.
